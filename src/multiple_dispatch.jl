md"# Writing Composable Software with Multiple Dispatch"

# ╔═╡ a3ed04f2-f079-11ea-3c88-9bdb95688687
md"If you've ever dabbled in Julia you may have heard the term multiple dispatch. The claim is that multiple dispatch allows you to easily write highly composable code.

I'd ask Chris Rackauckas something along the lines of 'Does Julia have a differentiable physics engine?' to which he'd answer 'well we have a physics engine and we have an autodiff library so because of multiple dispatch it just works, we just need to write a tutorial for it'.

I would nod my head in approval 'yes yes multiple dispatch of course'"

collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting asteroid
collide_with(x::Asteroid, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with asteroid hitting spaceship
collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Asteroid) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting asteroid
collide_with(x::Spaceship, y::Spaceship) = ... # deal with spaceship hitting spaceship

# ╔═╡ b50b57ee-f079-11ea-1fc1-d303920ecaeb
md"A few things crossed my mind when I saw this example
1. Ok so I can have the same function ```collide_with``` defined with various types - can't do this with Python
2. Why is this pseudocode?
3. Who the heck cares about asteroids?

So I decided to ask the Julia Slack channel for their favorite multiple dispatch tutorials and that comment generated over 120 reponses from the Julia community that taught me a lot about how multiple dispatch actually lets you write composable code.

I thought I'd summarize that thread in this blog post"

md"What I personally found fascinating about this example is that it gives a glimpse as to how you could create a physics engine or game engine with Julia. For example:

1. ```collide_with``` can work over any combination of shapes to implement a fully featured collision engine
2. ```play``` can work over any combination of game entities to implement the rules of a larger game

Great I thought! What else can I do?"

1. You don't have to muddy your code with ```if``` conditions to take into account special cases - try taking a look at the Keras codebase for how things are done there
2. If you come up with a new matrix with some unique properties you can make it multipliable without changing anyone elses code

This article would not be possible without the Julia community. I'm continuously surprised how much I learn about Math, Science and Programming just hanging out there.

Considering how I started out thinking multiple dispatch is only useful for something to do with asteroids, we ended up covering
1. Game/Physics Engines
2. Matrix Multiplication
3. Dealing with Uncertainty
4. Automatic Differentiation

If you enjoyed this post, you'll enjoy Julia even more so make your way to [JuliaLang.org](https://julialang.org/), it's a lot easier to build in Julia relative to other languages because of multiple dispatch and an amazing community.
